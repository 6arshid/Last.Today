<br/>
Last.Today with its advanced search engine allows users to search at
least 73 sources simultaneously.
<br/>
Resources that are categorized,
<br/>
For example, users can search for the word Trump in social networks,
news sources, economic sources, image, home, etc. at the same time.
<br>
<b>Publish without censorship after searching</b>
<br/>
In LT, it doesn't matter if you are Trump or Khamenei or a photographer or
an ordinary person, none of the users will be censored or suspended.
<br/>
Only one report is added to your reports next to the profile.
<br/>
For example, next to Khamenei's profile, there are a million people with
degrees. They have registered that he is a terrorist and he has the right to
defend himself and can send his answers to the reports that I am not a
terrorist, finally all users can see and read what a person is like and choose
for themselves. What kind of people are they in contact with?
<br/>
A very important point is that LT is managed by users and the majority of
users' votes like a country, and the opinion of managers or investors is like
the opinion of a normal user.
<br>
<b>Users can NFT their content</b>
<br/>
Each user can NFT their unique content and all NFT rules are followed.
<br/>
For example, instead of just producing content like Facebook or
Twitter, users can sell their content here as a creator.
<br>
<b>Crypto wallet</b><br/>
LT gives the user a crypto wallet that is placed on the Tron network.
<br/>
After any transaction, user can send a deposit request at the same
time, and after the LT share is reduced, the money will be deposited
into the user's Tron Wallet at the same time.
<br/>
We are also working on our own coin to have our own bank and coin
in the future under the name of LTCoin.
<br>
<b>User profile features</b><br/>
Possibility to park the domain instead of using the profile address
fx:last.today/@john change to john.com
<br/>
The possibility of changing the template
<br/>
For example, changing the format from a personal profile to a social
network app or to a company site or to an online store and more ‚Ä¶
<br/>
Ultimately, our goal for users is that they can build or manage any
site or mobile app by themselves with LT
fx : with LT, you can have your idea or program for mobile,
computer, etc
<br>
<b>Additional facilities</b><br/>
Simultaneous checking of social networks such as Instagram,
Facebook, Twitter, etc.
